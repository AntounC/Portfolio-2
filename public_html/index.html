                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <h2>My name is Charlie Antoun and I'm a dedicated Gamer</h2>
                <p>I have always had an interest in technology and mainly Video Games.
                I have been interested in the way video games were made because I've played them all my life.
                I have competed in a good amount of gaming tournaments and I have won 3 
                of them.</p>
